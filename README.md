=================

Three.js experiment: Load a landscape from a PNG-heightmap.

Just an experiment: I wanted to create a landscape-mesh after reading a heightmap from a PNG-file. 

There's a blogpost on this [here](http://lukaszielinski.de/blog/posts/2014/11/07/webgl-creating-a-landscape-mesh-with-three-dot-js-using-a-png-heightmap/ "Blogpost three js landscape").

(By the way, OrbitControls.js is taken from the three.js-examples. Please refer to [mrdoob/three.js ](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/ "Three.js repo").)
